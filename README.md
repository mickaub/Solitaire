# Solitaire
My Javascript version of the Solitaire game

13th Jun: Added basic HTML. Added 4 foundation cards, 7 board cards and the deck together with a new card.
Also added some basic CSS and began researching how to add SVG to cards.
Found that all solitaire playing cards are available as Unicode characters.

16th Jun: Added Card Object class, added all 52 cards as Card's.
Created Array out of all cards.
Added shuffle function, to shuffle all cards in random order.
Created first loop to colour cards either red or black when displayed.

ADD NEXT: change IDs of all board card slots to linear numbers, remove unneeded space, start adding extra rows of cards to board.
